### Advection.py
Solving the advection equation with both the Forward-Time Central-Space and Lax-Friedrichs methods, using a velocity u = -0.1 and fixed boundary conditions.

### Advection-Diffusion.py
Solving the advection-diffusion equation, with advection term solved using Lax-Friedrichs method and diffusion term using implicit operator splitting method for two different diffusion co-efficients (D = 1,5). Once again, a velocity u = -0.1 was used along with fixed (no-slip) boundary conditions.
